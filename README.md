## üìå **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchases using **SQL and Python (Pandas)**.  
It involves:
‚úî Cleaning and formatting SQL queries for better readability.  
‚úî Translating the SQL query logic into **Python using Pandas**.  
‚úî Filtering high-value purchases while ensuring product pricing is applied within a valid time frame.  
‚úî Identifying **frequent buyers** (customers with **10 or more** purchases).

## üìä **Dataset Description**
### **1. customer_purchases.csv**
| **Column Name** | **Description** |
|---------------|----------------|
| `customer_id` | Unique ID for each customer |
| `product_id`  | ID of the purchased product |
| `quantity`    | Number of items purchased |
| `purchase_date` | Date when the purchase was made |
| `country`     | Country of the customer |

### **2. product_price.csv**
| **Column Name** | **Description** |
|---------------|----------------|
| `product_id`  | ID of the product |
| `price`       | Price of the product |
| `valid_from`  | Start date for the product price validity |
| `valid_to`    | End date for the product price validity (NULL if still valid) |

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Steps Implemented**
### **1. SQL Query Reformatted**
- Improved query structure for readability.
- Ensured **customer filtering (‚â•10 purchases)** is applied correctly.
- Fixed **trailing commas and missing `GROUP BY` fields**.

### **2. SQL Query to Python Conversion (Using Pandas)**
- Read **CSV files into Pandas DataFrames**.
- Performed **LEFT JOIN** on `customer_purchases` and `product_price`.
- Applied **conditional filtering** to exclude purchases below a threshold.
- Implemented **grouping and aggregation** to calculate total purchase value.

## üìù **SQL Query**
```sql
SELECT 
    cp.product_id, 
    SUM(
        CASE 
            WHEN cp.quantity * pp.price < 50 THEN 0 
            ELSE cp.quantity * pp.price 
        END
    ) AS total, 
    cp.country
FROM customer_purchases cp
LEFT JOIN product_price pp 
    ON cp.product_id = pp.product_id
WHERE 
    cp.purchase_date >= pp.valid_from 
    AND (cp.purchase_date <= pp.valid_to OR pp.valid_to IS NULL)
    AND cp.customer_id IN (
        SELECT customer_id 
        FROM customer_purchases 
        GROUP BY customer_id 
        HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10
    )
GROUP BY cp.product_id, cp.country 
ORDER BY total DESC;
